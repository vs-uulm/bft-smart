This file describes how to run tests

1. Build the project using `ant jar`

2. Tests of this version may be run with the runscripts in the runscripts dir

 - runall.sh will start a new tmux session starting as many replicas as 
specified in hosts.conf and as many clients as specified in clients.conf

 - The results will be collected in the logdir with the executing hostname as 
prefix and  an incremented SEQNR for each run as suffix.

The call parameters are echoed to the respective log file of each test. E.g. how big 
the requests where, how many clients and so on.
